    <h1>Grant's Test Page</h1>
    <p>The goals of this website:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Get comfortable with personal projects again</li>
      <li>Refresh myself on basic HTML, and generally get back into webdev for fun after not touching it for a long time</li>
      <li>Start something from scratch, rather than working with an existing codebase/project</li>
      <li>Create a place to host my writing, audio readings, and eventually more complicated projects</li>
    </ul>
