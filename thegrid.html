		<h2>About the Grid</h2>
		<p>The Grid is an arrangement of anime that I've enjoyed over the years. Most of these I rated at least an 8 or higher on myanimelist at the time I watched them. There's some shows on here I don't reccomend in retrospect. There's also some shows that, while I enjoyed them and still think they are good, I probably wouldn't reccomend them to others. It was a big grid to fill, so I was a little forgiving in my inclusion of some (I even cheated a bit and included a visual novel in there!). </p>
		<p>I haven't ordered these in any particular fashion. Mostly I just wanted to get the art to fit well in given shapes. Some of my favourites did end up getting larger shapes, but that was more a consequence of me thinking of them first when constructing the grid</p>
		<p><i>Grid template image by Grex - see his grid and a link to his template <a href="https://twitter.com/GrexEleven/status/1162501653272113153" target="_blank">here</a>! </i></p>

		<h2>More Info</h2>
		<p>For now, keeping this all on same page. I may shift to separate pages or popups later, perhaps incrementally</p>
		<p>Shows will be classified into four categories. This isn't strictly A > B > C > D, but is rated on how easy it is for me to reccomend something or how accessible it is. One of my favourite shows is in Class C - I just don't think it'd be other peoples' favourite!</p>
		<ul>
			<li><b>Class A</b>: Near universal appeal, must-watch. These are also typically more focused experiences, hence the dominance of movies in this category</li>
			<li><b>Class B</b>: Excellent, quality content I reccomend and love, but reccomend with caveats and may not be for everyone.</li>
			<li><b>Class C</b>: I like and enjoy this (or parts of it), but either don't think it's objectively good enough or don't think it's something I'd reccomend as it's unlikely it'd suit most people's tastes. Also home to some guilty pleasures.</li>
			<li><b>Class D</b>: I enjoyed this enough to still include it in the grid, but I don't think I'd reccomend it to anyone. It may fit a niche you enjoy, but otherwise these are for people who already watch a fair bit of anime and may be interested in my thoughts. I liked them when I watched them, but most are from years ago and I've moved on, matured and/or upped my standards. In future revisions these will be the first to be removed from the grid, as I don't really stand by them anymore.</li>
		</ul>

		<div class="moreinfo" id="chuunibyou">
			<h3 class="classd">Love, Chuunibyou, and Other Delusions</h3>			
			<ul>
				<li>Romantic comedy with a light tone, "moe" slice of life</li>
				<li>High School setting</li>
				<li>Eccentric main girl & friends</li>
				<li>Commitment: 2x12 episode seasons, plus a movie</li>
			</ul>
			<p>I watched this several years ago, so it's a little fuzzy, but it's one of the more iconic shows of its kind. Don't expect anything spectacular, it's very tropey and I feel you need to be familiar with the fantasy-anime aethestic to really relate to some of the gags. The comedy isn't anything special. As far as characters go, the main guy is a bit generic but this is a deliberate choice as he is paired with an eccentric main girl lead which is a major premise of the show. You get a bunch of nice "awwww" moments - to enjoy the show you really have to be invested in shipping the two leads together. The dub's VA for the main girl is probably one of my favourites. The secondary characters are a mixed bag - I liked one of them, but another is a very much one-note character and I despised the last one. Season 2 introduces a new character that I really didn't care for either. I watched the movie more recently (as it released 4 years afterwards), and definitely think it improved on the not-so-great second season, as it takes place after a time skip with older characters and gives some much needed closure. That being said, this is one of those shows that I feel I'm nearly a decade too old for now - If you're going to watch this, do so intending to watch something teenage-you would like.</p>

		<div class="moreinfo" id="paranoiaagent">
			<h3 class="classa">Paranoia Agent</h3>			
			<ul>
				<li>Psychological thriller</li>
				<li>Variety of excellent, very different characters</li>
				<li>Great Animation & Direction</li>
				<li>Commitment: 13 episodes</li>
			</ul>
			<p>The premise is simple enough: after several people are attacked by a mysterious thug, the police try to track down evidence to apprehend the perpetrator. What we get along the way are some great character arcs as the list of victims and fear grows. The show is great at building tension and anxiety, you can really get a sense of madness at times. Things get pretty twisted. The one thing that may throw viewers off is how often the story moves around in mostly disconnected ways. That being said, this is an absolutely incredible show.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="moreinfo" id="goldenkamuy">
			<h3 class="classc">Golden Kamuy</h3>			
			<ul>
				<li>Action-Adventure hunt for lost gold. Serious, viceral tone alternates with lighter or ridiculous situations and a bit of comedy.</li>
				<li>Set in post-Russo-Japanese-war Hokkaido</li>
				<li>Main guy and main villain are great, large character roster</li>
				<li>Commitment: 3x12 episode seasons</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Golden Kamuy has a fresh, interesting setting with some great characters. The show explores the life, food & practices of the Ainu indigenous peoples in a cool way. Everything about this anime feels novel and exciting. I found myself sometimes losing the thread with all the characters and their motivations, but it's a quality show. The humour didn't always land for me. I have yet to watch Season 3, so can't comment on that, but it seems to have been reviewed quite highly like the rest of the series.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="moreinfo" id="redline">
			<h3 class="classa">Redline</h3>			
			<ul>
				<li>Insanely over-the-top anything-goes sci-fi racing</li>
				<li>Gorgeous and stylistic art & animation - seriously you've seen nothing like it</li>
				<li>Adrenline and pulse-pounding action a priority over story</li>
				<li>Commitment: 1 Movie</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Redline is a must-watch. This high-octane movie is pure spectacle, and wow - what a spectacle it is. Character designs are phenomenal, animation is slick and crazy. The races themselves are pure eye-candy. The first time I watched this I was so pumped, it still gets me going after several rewatches. Soundtrack and sound effects are also amazing, so make sure you've got a good audio setup in addition to a high-resolution source</p>
		</div>
		<div class="moreinfo" id="girlsundpanzer">
			<h3 class="classd">Girls und Panzer</h3>			
			<ul>
				<li>Tank-combat-as-a-sport. Tone is very light, battles can have some fun moments.</li>
				<li>High-school setting, but you could probably skip that and just watch tank battles</li>
				<li>Forgettable/annoying characters to the detriment of the experience</li>
				<li>Commitment: 12 episodes + 1 Movie + ongoing series of films I haven't seen yet</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Honestly, don't bother with this unless you <i>really</i> like tanks. Military history fans will also appreciate some historical jokes & references. The characters who drive the tanks are cutesy high school girls, there's a lot of them and none of them are any good. Any drama that happens outside of the tanks is inane and boring. The only reason this is on here is the tank battles are fun. They use interesting real-world tactics, but also take it up a notch with some wackier tactics or things like tank drifting. Some good orchestral music tracks have also come out of the show that are good modern recordings of classic national war songs, but just go listen to those on youtube.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="moreinfo" id="sayiloveyou">
			<h3 class="classc">Say "I Love You."</h3>			
			<ul>
				<li>Dramatic romance</li>
				<li>Mature high school setting</li>
				<li>Very cliche love story, but with a change of pace</li>
				<li>Commitment: 13 episodes</li>
			</ul>
			<p>This is a very generic, middle of the road kind of show but it isn't bad. An insecure, loner-type girl has an encounter with the popular guy at school, which leads to friendship and then romance. It's a shoujo, which means the audience is young women - so we definitely see the themes tackled from the heroine's point of view, which are conflicts and insecurities that young women face with each other and with guys they like. For someone like me, it's a nice change in perspective and I enjoyed the mature, realistic take on young romance (or at least more realistic - it's still definitely fiction!). The show avoids going into will-they-won't-they territory like many other do. If you're okay with cliche, and want a romance show, give it a shot!</p>
		</div>
		<div class="moreinfo" id="lupiniii">
			<h3 class="classa">Lupin III (Castle of Cagliostro)</h3>			
			<ul>
				<li>Classic Damsel-in-distress adventure</li>
				<li>European countryside with medieval aesthetics (but still set in the modern 20th century)</li>
				<li>Titular lead is iconic and great, as is his trusty partner</li>
				<li>Commitment: 1 movie (and if you like the gang, dozens more movies and hundreds more episodes from 5-going-on-6 seasons in a catalogue that's been ongoing since the 60s, which are all standalone)</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Lupin III is the world's greatest gentleman thief, and he and his gang have been featured in countless standalone adventures that have been ongoing since the 60s. Castle of Cagliostro is a Miyazaki-animated film from the 70s that is one of the best pieces of Lupin content that's been made. It's a beautifully animated fun adventure with likeable characters. Everything about the movie is a charming classic. I think this is a must-watch for anyone. It's a simple familiar plot, but well worth the watch. </p>
		</div>
		<div class="moreinfo" id="quintessentialquintuplets">
			<h3 class="classd">Quintessential Quintuplets</h3>			
			<ul>
				<li>Lighthearted romantic comedy-drama about a guy tutoring 5 sisters who are, you guessed it, quintuplets</li>
				<li>Each quintuplet and the main protagonist have a lot of individual character and charm and are easily likeable</li>
				<li>Generally a well put together feel-good show that's just as much about friendship and family as it romance</li>
				<li>Commitment: 12 + 12 episodes + 1 movie</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Look, this sounds like an ecchi-sketchy harem anime and it like <i>kinda</i> is a bit, but it's so much better than anything in the category. There are many reasons why these kind of shows usually suck. First of all, the protagonist is often a clueless, boring self insert. Futaro has a backbone, character, and is a genuinely thoughtful character who doesn't just exist to play gags on. Harems also have the problem of fragmenting their stories with individual girls, but since they're all sisters the story is just as much about their relationships with each other and coming to terms with their individuality. None of the characters fall into the annoying tropes so common in romantic comedy harems, and the romance builds organically and believably rather than out of nowhere. There's occaisonal moments of intimacy that feel fantastic and deserved. They slowly figure out their awkwardness and lower their guard, slowly coming to terms with how they feel. All the girls are very different, yet unified in a way through family - I find myself rooting for everyone easily. After the movie came out, which actually completes the story (rare in the romantic comedy world!), I went to go see it in theatres. It was a really special moment. I found myself grinning ear-to-ear by the end and frankly a little teary eyed at the closure. I decided this would be the final anime I watch (beyond watching as a group to be social or for an AMV) - it felt like the final chapter in all the anime I had ever watched. That said, this was a very personal experience peculiar to myself. The show is nothing incredible, and looking back I don't know how I ended up caring so much about this show so much, but somehow it found its way into my heart. I don't think I was the only one - the show is pretty well regarded for a romantic comedy, and everyone has their favourite girl they were rooting for. But for me, I look back on it and smile.</p>

		<div class="moreinfo" id="drifters">
			<h3 class="classd">Drifters</h3>			
			<ul>
				<li>Gritty fighting action, unfortunate attempts at comedy</li>
				<li>Fantasy setting mixed with real-world historical characters throughout history</li>
				<li>Lead character is pretty hype, story is pretty simple. Can get dark.</li>
				<li>Commitment: 12 episodes</li>
			</ul>
			<p>This is a junk food show. The premise is pretty fast and loose - theres a war in this fantasy world and historical figures from earth like Oda Nobunaga, Hannibal, Butch Cassidy, and Joan of Arc have been brought here after they die. There are some really solid moments, especially when the show gets dark. Main guy is a total "chad" for lack of a better word. On those grounds alone, it might be an okay dumb fighting show with some edgy themes and some historical references. However, the show insists on sticking comedy everywhere which is awful elementary-school-level immature humour or similar low-grade fare. The story is practically non-existant, just an excuse for people to fight basically. It's been a long time since I saw this one - I enjoyed it enough at the time, but wouldn't reccomend it to anyone as I don't think it was really all that good in retrospect. The story doesn't end conclusively in the show - more seasons were supposed to come out but never materialized - but given how unimportant it is to the bloodsport, it's probably fine.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="moreinfo" id="fujikomine">
			<h3 class="classb">Lupin III: A Woman Called Fujiko Mine</h3>			
			<ul>
				<li>Gritty Film Noir, Psychological, Crime</li>
				<li>Very appropriate and unique art style</li>
				<li>Excellent characters - you may appreciate them more if you have seen other Lupin III shows/movies first, but not required</li>

			<p>A fresh take on the adventures of the Lupin III franchise. Fujiko Mine is primarily about one of the regular members of Lupin III gang, who is probably one of the greatest femme fatales in anime. It's sort of an origin story, so it's safe to start here, but if you've watched other Lupin III content (eg: <a href="#lupiniii">Castle of Cagliostro</a>, Lupin III Part IV) you may get some enjoyment from seeing this bold reinterpretation. Nevertheless, the show is oozing with class and mystery. It's unsettling, sensual, tense - yet still has exciting moments of action like you'd expect from the franchise as the characters attempt to pull off their heists. A fair warning - the show contains several instances of nudity/suggestive content, even in the opening.</p>

				<li>Well-explored protagonists - this show is all about the characters</li>
				<li>Commitment: 24 episodes</li>
			</ul>
			<p>This is one of the best shows on the list, but one I hesitate to call a must watch. Pretty much the only bad thing about the show is that the art isn't anything fancy. However, I don't know how much just anyone would relate to the characters in the show. When you watch Welcome to the NHK, you're watching a story about a young man who is pathetic, alone, and a coward. He's lost to the world - and resigned to his fate. Someone arrives and offers to save him. What follows are the attempts to fix his life, and an exploration of the characters and their insecurities and failures. It's incredibly real, but I think some people may just look at the protagonists and not care for them, or think they're being overly dramatic. It is a work of fiction, so it is of course exaggerated for effect, but the story of our protagonists is a real one that many people face in varying degrees. It's the kind of show that makes you take steps to prevent becoming like the main character. I did say it was a comedy as well - despite the depressing realities, it's actually got some funny moments. It's also got moments that make you smile that help balance out the constant head-shaking you do when watching the show. There are some suggestive image stills </p>

			<p>This is a real sleeper masterpiece. So much thought has gone into designing the world in this movie, from the technology, to the money, to the table utensils. There's so many neat touches that make you pause and think "What a creative design". The plot is fairly simple, it moves forwards slowly towards its goal, with the stakes rising the further into the movie you go. Our main character is just an average joe, but his supporting character is a rare kind of character in cinema these days. The personal journey isn't anything groundbreaking, but a slow march to finding his place. There's one scene where my heart breaks. Definitely worth a watch, I don't think there's anything like it out there - just don't expect a thrilling classic adventure.</p>

			<p>There's some debate on whether you should watch this before or after Gundam 0079. Many people think that even though it's a prequel, you should watch the original anime first. However, I had been skeptical of the original show's dated artstyle and juvenile characters. I also felt the story was too weighed down by plot armour and "battle of the week" style storylines, and had never managed to get very far. This was a breath of fresh air - great modern animation, and a story about the events leading up to the start of 0079 with a focus on the characters that go on to be the "bad guys" of 0079. There's intrigue, combat, political drama following the rise of the Red Comet himself. I did eventually go on to watch the original 0079 anime after being excited by what I saw in the origin, and I'm glad I watched it in this order. It really ups the stakes of characters that appear in that show, fleshes out the universe and made me more invested. As a standalone series, The Origin is still great, and worth a watch. As a prequel, there actually isn't a ton of mecha combat until later in the show, but I think it was better that they take the time to focus on the characters rather than fight scenes in the limited time they had.</p>

It's primarily about our main characters, and does storyteling in an interesting way. I went in with high expectations and the movie surprised me.

				<li>Commitment: 12 episodes + 1 movie (haven't seen yet)</li>
			</ul>
			<p>This show is all about the protagonist - the titular Tanya is cold, vicious, intelligent, and ruthlessly competent. In any other show, this would be raising the Mary Sue trope flags, but the scope of her conflict evens the odds in an interesting, novel way. She has a wild, animal-like energy with "want to watch the world burn" vibes, but it's balanced well with a pragmatic, almost "bored" efficiency that makes her an interesting character. The World War setting is interesting for fans of warfare of those time periods, and is familiar enough that no large amount of time must be spent on exposition for it. The quality of the art varies - some of the 3D CG is pretty egregious and character designs aren't fantastic, but other times such as fight scenes are very well done. As a note, the series is mostly told from the perspective of Tanya, but the first episode takes more of an outsider's perspective - I would reccomend watching at least 2 episodes so that you can hear Tanya's side of things and understand the broader premise</p>

			</ul>
			<p>Full Metal Panic has one of the best comedy characters in anime. While the overall comedy can be cliche high school comedy at times, his gags/lines are well done and his vocal, deadpan delivery is unique. The mecha action is pretty good, but gets a little fast and loose with some of the technology (although I felt the most recent season avoided this problem). I think where Full Metal Panic shined was in combining two different genres together in a way that didn't seem unnatural. It helps balance the relationship between the two main characters, as in the action sequences the soldier is being the hero and saving the day (and sometimes the girl too), but in the slice of life sequences he's a fish out of water who has to be carried by the no-nonsense main girl. It also gives us an opportunity to get to know the characters better then throw them into high stakes situations. As for the art, it's a little on the older side in the first hybrid season  and the comedy season with the old timey aspect ratio (but honestly, for 2002, that first season looks great), but there's a fantastic visual upgrade in the first serious season, and the modern 2nd serious season 13 years later looks amazing. It's a bit of a jack-of-all-trades, master of none show but I've yet to see another show do better at mixing such comedy and serious action, and I love the main characters. It's safe to skip the comedy season I think if you're more into the serious stuff after the first one.</p>

Legend says that 4chan memed this into getting an anime adaption back in its "glory" days. It's an episodic format mostly, with our girl getting herself into awful situations or digging herself into a hole. The vocal performance is spot-on - you can feel her hopes & anticipations just as vividly as you experience the anguish when they are crushed. Helping to offset this is her sense of superiority despite her sorry state. Pretty bangin' opening song.</p>

			<p>This is one of the best romantic comedy animes on the market, it's the one everyone points you to, and is often one of the first few anime people watch. And for good reason - it's really good. It balances the comedy highjinks with feelings, uncertainties, angst, frustrations, and intimacy that you'd expect in a romance. The show isn't just about romance but also about friendship. With 25 episodes, you get a long time to really see the characters developed and a chance to put them through different situations. Every now and then I do a rewatch of this show with friends or family, and I find it's got great potential to discuss and reflect with others. </p>

			</ul>
			<p>While I watched Robotech previously, it was my friend inviting me to sit down and watch two episodes of FLCL with him that opened up the genre to me. I remember getting to the end of an episode and being excited to see what the show would do next. It's really, really hard to explain what this show is concretely. It's bizzare, defiant, and maintains an air of mystery - the curtain is never fully drawn. It has the air of that turn of the millenium teenage angst (it aired in the year 2000). I love Haruka's character, and she has an incredibly unique voice in the dub. It's the sort of show made for rewatches, between the short length and opportunity to interpret deeper meaning and catch clues the show drops, so I've seen it many times and still love it. The only weakness that tends to hold me back on reccomending this to anyone is that the frantic comedy sometimes doesn't land, or feels too anime-y, but it's not a big issue and is not the reason you're watching. As a fun side note, if you were a fan of Avatar: The Last Airbender, anyone working on that show was required to watch FLCL - you can definitely see the influence in how it makes the silly vs serious dynamic work.</p>

The story isn't anything incredible, it's more about the characters figuring each other out with low drama, all the while managing to be the sweetest, most adorable thing I have ever watched. Excellent friendship between the main guy characters adds an extra level of charm. Good if you want something light, but not just filler.</p>

			<p>Katawa Shoujo getting made was something of a miracle that hasn't really been topped since. I won't go into the story but it's worth reading up on. The end result was a unique visual novel experience that still handled its subject matter remarkably respectfully. If you want advice on which route to go for (stop reading if you want to try a blind run first!)

			<p>Scum's wish is a story about people being selfish to fulfill their deepest, darkest desires. When I watched this, I excitedly journalled how I felt. It was as if this show painted in colours other romance anime never dared touch. Watching people being deliberately cruel, unhealthy, irrational, manipulative, abusive and uncaring is uncomfortable. You feel like you're condoning their actions and feelings just by being a bystander to them. That's part of why this anime is so polarizing. Intense characterization and a roller coaster of emotions make this worthy of a watch - but not everyone may be drawn in by the darker, hopeless, baser side of the romance genre. The show makes you feel frustrated and angry, in a good way somehow that doesn't delight in suffering. It's hard to explain. As a side note, the dub voice for the main character is incredibly good.</p>

			<p>If I had to name an anime that was my favourite, this would be it. I've rewatched it so many times I've lost count, but it never fails to grab me. My face gets flush and warm, my skin tingles. I know what's going to happen but there's always such an intimacy and anticipation that no other show has managed to replicate. Even just the first episode, taken entirely on its own, is a magical and full story that would put full series to shame. Nobody talks about or seems to ever know about this show - it feels very personal and unique to me. I've tried to explain my experience watching it to others but everyone gets hung up on that...one thing... I'll talk about later. To me, Mysterious Girlfriend X is the best story about a boy and a girl growing closer together, discovering what a relationship means to them, experiencing emotions they've never felt before, and understanding the deep desire they begin to have for each other. The show handles romance without tropes - their story feels like <i>their</i> story.<br><br>

			Urabe, the female lead is played by my favourite voice actress and the voice acting for the male lead, Akira, fits absolutely perfectly. Mysterious Girlfriend is focused on these two (although we do get a small number of supporting characters, they stick to <i>supporting</i>) and slowly builds their relationship. Now that I've lavished praise over this series, the major turn off for Mysterious Girlfriend X is a large part of the premise: Drool. That's right, that gross slimy substance inside your mouth. While not played as a sexual fetish, drool plays an important intimate role in this show in a way that in real life would be really gross. I am not going to go into a full description, but you have been warned. What's worse is the first episode is by far the worst offender in terms of gross-factor, and from then on it's really not as bad. Trust me though - there is something profoundly good in this show - and the grossness is integral to that story. Still don't want to watch it? Fine. I can't get this show out of my head, and would love to talk about even if you don't watch it.</p>

			</ul>
			<p>I have a weird thing for girls wearing eyepatches. I can't really explain it, I just love it. Therein lies the shallow reason I picked up this series. When I went to watch it, it felt very familiar - I later realized I had watched at least some of the prologue episode and had totally forgotten about it. In retrospect, this is supremely ironic given the subject matter, but I digress. I was pleasantly surprised with this series - it had a very intimate feel to it, where we really got to explore the characters' doubts, hopes, fears, pain, longing and everything in between. The story is based off a visual novel, which is a dying breed of anime source material sadly. Its heritage birthed some spectacular moments where you are just fully immersed in pure emotion for several minutes at a time. Some of these were painfully harrowing that I genuinely felt distressed watching them. Visual novel-based anime tends to have this ethereal, deliberate feel to it that I wish we had more of. The story is rich in subtext and layered character storytelling and several elements 'rhyme' with other facilitating a holistic exploration. It's certainly a drama, and that comes with its melodrama, but does not feel overly contrived. I found myself initially not liking some characters, as if they were shallow and simplistic, only to have the series pay off in ways that made me fully appreciate them by the end of the show.</p>

			<p>There's a destructive element to listening to the opinions of others - you sometimes find yourself incorporating their views as your own, losing the original pure impression you had. My opinion on Domestic Girlfriend has been heavily dilluted by the strong and loud opinions floating around on the internet about it, such that I'm really not sure how I personally felt about it. I do know that I went into this show sort of blind, I hadn't even put two-and-two together with the title. It was just a show that I knew was a heavier romance that was coming out on HiDive dubbed at the time, I didn't even realize I was watching a censored version. What I do know is that I was hooked - as entertainment, it really grabbed me and made it hard to put down. I think that the two things Domestic Girlfriend has going for it are tension and the guts to push the boundary lines that other shows might be otherwise unwilling to do. That being said, the main character is sort of a pathetic character often - this really hurt the show. The female leads had their own motivations and drove a lot of the plot, but the male lead just sort of floats along.</p>

			<p>Before watching this show, I would never have considered watching an Idol anime, but here we are. Zombieland Saga manages to somehow make the Idol genre interesting, with unique challenges and characters. This show largely survives on its premise and humour, but it'll win a place in your heart with its songs. No relation to the 2009 movie "Zombieland".</p>

			<h3 class="classc">Horimya</h3>			
			<ul>
				<li>A more modern take on the classic rom-com</li>
				<li>Main characters feel fresh and likeable with good emotional intelligence, but side characters are numerous, average and forgetable</li>
				<li>Captures different stages of attraction pretty well</li>
				<li>Commitment: 13 Episodes</li>
			</ul>
			<p>I liked this show a lot when I first started it and it was focused more on the two main characters. The romance was more bold and real for a romantic comedy compared to something like <i>My Love Story</i> or <i>Love, Chuunibyou and Other Delusions</i>. It was like the authors decided not to screw around and skipped to the part rom-com animes never get to. The series kind of lost momentum towards the end, getting mired in the mud of side characters and arcs. There were so many side characters, and all of them were either forgetable or annoying. While it was still good television, it became a bit more formulaic and the time that passed between each episode viewing got longer. It took me months to get around to actually watching the final episode. I partly blame myself for watching the much more intense <i>Scum's Wish</i> and a few other shows I loved around this so that Horimya paled in comparison. The story and character development threads might not be as strong as something like <i>Toradora!</i> but it feels like a more casual, modern romantic comedy in the same vein perhaps. I think I'd say it's my second favourite Romance with comedy elements (as opposed to a comedy with romantic elements like <i>School Rumble</i>). As an aside, you may have noticed I ended up referencing a lot of other specific shows - this is because in anime the romance genre and especially the rom-com subgenre have significant overlap with each other. It's easy to burn out on this, like I found myself doing ~2016-2017, so try to space out your viewings!</p>

				<li>Almost dream-like atmosphere at times, otherwise just a really nice wholesome show.</li>
				<li>Season 2 makes watching Season 1 worth it (which is more of a Class C or D type)</li>
				<li>Commitment: 23 + 24 episodes (Season 2 is called "Clannad: After Story")</li>
			</ul>
			<p>I'm glad I watched Clannad when I did - I was working on a co-op term, and had a lot more free time to chew through the first season. There was some fun moments, but I was really burnt out on this kind of show. It's not bad, it's just very average, especially when watched so close to similar shows. I had been told that Season 2 was really good though, and that encouraged me to keep going. By the end though I actually needed a break, and shelved it until I felt ready to watch Season 2. That first season in retrospect felt a lot like <i>Angel Beats</i>, a little supernatural with emotional moments interspersed with young people just living their life in a pleasant, trope-y way that ultimately was extremely forgettable. I couldn't tell you almost anything about it - I only recently saw a clip that reminded me that a certain character I had forgotten existed (which was ironic, given this character's arc). It wasn't until next year that I got around to Season 2... which was pretty much exactly the same as Season 1. I was discouraged by this at the time, but it was a good ramp back into the show after being gone so long. Once Season 2 really got going it told one of the best stories I've watched in anime that more than redeemed the more lackluster beginning. What's more, having watched all of season one really enhanced my appreciation for the 2nd season. The first season needs to be juxtaposed with the second. If you can handle the slower pace, it's absolutely worth a watch to reach the end of this slow-burn show. One other thing to note: this show is based off a visual novel, which helps to understand where certain relationships go with the main character structure-wise. I remember being a little confused on some small narrative choices in the first season, but knowing this explained why they were written that way.</p>

			<h3 class="classb">Monthly Girls' Nozaki-kun</h3>			
			<ul>
				<li>Colourful playful romantic comedy that parodies tropes of the genre</li>
				<li>Both main and supporting characters all have great, distinct personalities that make for an enjoyable romp</li>
				<li>Great animation for this type of genre, which usually tends to be more low-rent</li>
				<li>Commitment: 12 Episodes</li>
			</ul>
			<p>In general, I find it hard to reccomend comedic anime - especially high school ones. Jokes tend to be immature/childish in nature, and the characters are over the top. Sometimes I'll still enjoy situation comedy, as with <i>School Rumble</i>, but as much as I love that show even it is very hit and miss for an older viewer. Nozaki-kun bucks the trend here, in that over 5 years since I originally watched it I still find it incredibly funny, and is entirely accessible to someone who would normally be adverse to anime-style light comedy. What's great about Nozaki-kun's parody humour is that it doesn't require prior, extensive knowledge of the genre to 'get' the jokes. Instead, it will present the stereotypical approach then find a hilarious way to take a... different path. Essentially, it sets the expectations, then subverts them and does so without feeling patronizing. All the characters are good, so you don't hate it when they spend some time on side character arcs. On top of this, it has a very fresh look to it visually that helps tie a neat bow on a fantastic package of a show. Don't expect anything terribly serious in the romance department, this is a comedy first and foremost.</p>

			<h3 class="classc">Kiss Him, Not Me!</h3>			
			<ul>
				<li>Reverse-harem (one main girl with five suitors) light romantic comedy, with a <a href="https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/feature/2016-12-21/what-is-a-fujoshi/.109594" target="_blank">twist</a>.</li>
				<li>Fun slice of life antics and some likeable characters. Main girl has my favourite hair colour in all of anime.</li>
				<li>A fairly average show, but stands out for a good dynamic between the characters.</li>
				<li>Commitment: 12 Episodes</li>
			</ul>
			<p>This is always the hardest one to explain to other people, and I don't think there's any chance I'll reccomend this to anyone. It's the poster child of "Guilty Pleasure" in my book. Being a straight guy, I'm definitely not the target audience nor am I on the same wavelength for Kae's feral shipping. I do find that in having this anime be targeted towards a specific kind of real-life woman, it helps make the main girl much more realistic as a person intended to be a self-insert (normal harems tend to devolve to archetypes). The suitors aren't particularly special, but at least three of the five grew on me once the series spent some time on them. Because of the BL-shipping twist, Kiss Him Not Me ends up showing us a lot more inter-suitor interactions. Typically harems focus on suitor-protagonist relationships, which makes a lot of the show feel empty and one dimensional (plus any scene without your favoured suitor feels like a waste of time). This was exactly why a show like <i>Infinite Stratos</i> fell flat for me despite liking Charlotte Dunois (well okay, there was <i>a lot</i> wrong with that show). The suitors and the protagonist in Kiss Him Not Me end up feeling like a rag-tag group of friends who just all happen to be in love with the same girl. That said, this show isn't for everyone - it's a weird premise and the humour isn't top notch but somehow I ended up still liking it enough to enjoy a rewatch years later.</p>

			<ul>
				<li>Early 2000s school romantic comedy</li>

				<li>Zany situational humour that somewhat parodies the genre</li>
				<li>Commitment: </li>
			</ul>
			<p>School rumble is tough - I love this show to death for so many reasons, but I don't know if other people will 'get' it. On the surface, it's got dated animation, typical childish anime humour, a few annoying characters. The entire flow of the story is built on misunderstanding after misunderstanding, usually a red flag for me. There's even a literal cabal of pervy guys! It screams early 2000s. All that said, it's still absolutely hilarious a lot of the time. The romance is scattered about and played for humour, but there's many times where two characters despite their antics stumble upon real, honest intimacy that never fails to warm my heart. Everyone in the school is friends with each other in their own way and I love it. Somehow, School Rumble ended up being one of my absolute favourite shows ever. I wish I could explain this show to people but I'm still trying to explain it to myself. All I'll say is it's somehow really good, and I must have rewatched the whole thing 3-4 times at least since I first watched it over 5 years ago. Every time I go to sit down and watch an episode, I'll tell myself "surely I've outgrown this, I'm expecting this to be cringe", but I never do. School Rumble is also the only show ever that I've gone and read the manga after the anime to the end.</p>

			<h3 class="classb">Mobile Suit Gundam: Iron Blooded Orphans</h3>			
			<ul>
				<li>Mecha action with wider political ramifications in an standalone alternate universe</li>
				<li>Serious tone, lower tech and gritty subject matter, and a cause worth fighting for.</li>
				<li>Great group character development, and lots of characters.</li>
				<li>Commitment: 25 + 25 episodes</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Iron Blooded Orphans was my first forray into a gundam series. It's extremely accessible, and manages to avoid some of the weaknesses and dated tropes of the main Universal Century timeline. Despite this, it still feels like a gundam show - even when it is subverting a trope, it echoes the originals. The show tends to alternate between amazing combat scenes and spending time developing its cast of characters and the setting. Because the show takes a lower-tech approach, mech designs feel neither too over-the-top flashy nor cartoonish. Iron Blooded Orphans takes on difficult subject matter, such as the lives of child soldiers, slavery, revolution, and corruption. It's a heavy show, but the titular orphans make it a fight that you get caught up in and hyped for - it's a passionate crusade of sorts against a world that looks down on them. Iron Blooded Orphans is best for the viewer who wants to try Gundam, but doesn't want to commit to the whole Universal Century timeline (yet).</p>
